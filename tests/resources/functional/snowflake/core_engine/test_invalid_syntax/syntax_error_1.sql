-- Note that here we have two commas in the select clause and although in other circumstances,
-- the parser coudl notice that is an additional comma, in this case it is not able to do so because
-- what can be in between the comma is just about anything. Then because any ID is accepted as
-- possibly being some kind of command, then the parser has to assume that the following tokens
-- are some valid command.
-- Hence this error is thrown by a no viable alternative at input ',' and the parser recovers to something
-- that looks like it is a valid command because of the let rule where LET is optional and the next token
-- is an ID, which is therefore predicted and we will accumulate a lot of erroneous errors.
